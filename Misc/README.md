# Misc

Random miscellaneous contracts.

### Ipfs Experiment
Only the ts.js is interesting here. Basic use of IPFS in JS, adding a file to IPFS then saving its hash in a contract.

### Zeppelin Ethernaut
Contracts for completing the Zeppelin Ethernaut challenge (https://ethernaut.zeppelin.solutions/). Primarily an example of exploiting the reentrancy vulnerability (the issue allowing the DAO hack).

### Assembly Experiments
Tests for some basic assembly instructions, including delegatecall. I expect to add to this as I need to understand more assembly.

### Aragon Test
An attempt at the Aragon Solidity Developer application test, unfinished.

### Meta Transactions
Experimenting with MetaTransactions. Investigation is mainly based on the LimeChain implementation from here: https://github.com/LimeChain/IdentityProxy
