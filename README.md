Contracts written in Solidity, using Truffle for deployment and testing. 

These are primarily for personal development. I have been using the decypher.tv tutorials and implementing proposed contracts before watching their coresponding videos.

<b>BasicEscrow</b> - Vary basic Escrow contract written to understand the basics of Unit Testing with Truffle and to start learning Solidity. The file ts.js can be commented/uncommented and executed with 'exec ts.js' from the truffle console to play with a deployed Escrow contract. There are basic Unit tests written in Solidity and JS.

<b>CoinFlipper</b> - Basic coin flipper game. Two participants both put in the same amount of Ether and one of them gets it all sent back to them determined by block hashes.
