# solidity-playground

Contracts written in Solidity, using Truffle for deployment and testing. 

See individual folders readme's for details regarding the contracts within.

These are primarily for personal development, in order of when I wrote them (the first one's in the lists are the most recent and best representation of my understanding of Solidity). 

I started by using the decypher.tv tutorials for inspiration, implementing proposed contracts before watching their coresponding videos. I finally moved onto building larger sets of contracts.

Note: <code>npm install</code> is required in the root dir to get web3 if wanting to execute the 'ts.js' scripts.
