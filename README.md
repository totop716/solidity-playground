# solidity-playground

Contracts written in Solidity, using Truffle for deployment and testing. 

See the individual folders Readme's for details regarding the contracts within.

These are primarily for personal development, in order of when I wrote them (the first one's described in each of the lists/folders are the most recent and best representation of my understanding of Solidity). I started by using the decypher.tv tutorials for inspiration. I then moved on to building larger sets of contracts which can be seen in Tokens, Governance, Upgradable and Misc.

### DecypherTv:
- Crowdsale
- Coin Flipper (uses Oraclize)
- Basic Escrow

### Tokens:
- ERC223
- MiniMe Testing
- Youtube Token (uses Oraclize)

### Governance:
- Liquid Democracy (WIP)
- Liquid Lockable Vote
- Futarchy (SchellingVote)
- Basic Vote

### Upgradable:
- Byzantium Upgradable
- Ether Router
- Zeppelin Upgradable Proxy
- Fallback Storage Access Test

### Misc:
- MetaTransactions
- Aragon Test
- Assembly Experiments
- Zeppelin Ethernaut
- Ipfs Experiment 

More recent Truffle projects have JS tests for demonstrating functionality, older projects use JS scripts executed directly through the Truffle console.

Note: <code>npm install</code> is required in some projects eg for Zeppelin Contracts.
