# solidity-playground-2
More recent experiments with Solidity than those in solidity-playground.

<b>ERC23</b><br/>
Basic implementation of the current ERC223 token proposal with minimal tests for experimentation. Largely copied from Aragon's implementation here: https://github.com/aragon/ERC23. Demonstrates how to call functions using byte/hex encoded function calls.

<b>MiniMeTesting</b><br/>
Playing with the Giveth MiniMeToken from https://github.com/Giveth/minime with some basic tests to understand its functionality.
