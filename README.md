# solidity-playground-2
More recent experiments with Solidity than those in solidity-playground.

<b>ERC23</b><br/>
Basic implementation of an ERC23 Token. I will extend this and add to the `StandardTokenReceiver` to expriment with computing and passing signatures around. 

<b>MiniMeTesting</b><br/>
WIP. Playing with the Giveth MiniMeToken from https://github.com/Giveth/minime. Written some tests to understand how it works.
